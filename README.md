-"algorithms_LOO_maxant1.py" and "algorithms_LOO_maxant2.py" contains classes for TRuleGrowth and RuleGrowth algorithms. 
To change the algorithm in order to use at the process, its only necessary to change the line "ExecuteRuleGrowth", at the "LOO" class.
This two codes apply the leave-one-out method.

-"crossvalidation_maxant1.py" and "crossvalidation_maxant2.py" apply the cross-validation method and also contains classes for TRuleGrowth and RuleGrowth algorithms, being necessary to do the same process in order to change the algorithm.

"sai" it's the database used to produce the "input.txt" file, with the information of 49 students.
